# Surviv.io Extension Hack
A very simple surviv hack because I am so tired of complex stuff. Basically these features

* Bigger zoom
* No roofs
* Transparent smoke (currently in the works)

Install by downloading the <a href="https://github.com/IceHacks/surviv-extension/archive/master.zip">ZIP</a> and doing the following.

* Extract the <a href="https://github.com/IceHacks/surviv-extension/archive/master.zip">ZIP</a> to a folder on your PC.
* Open `chrome://extensions` and click `developer mode`
* Next, click `load unpacked extension` find the directory of the extension.
* Install it and play surviv.io

Be careful I was banned but I was using a VPN so I don't care.

Once I have 5 dollars I can publish to the Chrome Extensions store and installation is one click.
